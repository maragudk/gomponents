gomponents are components of DOM nodes for Go, that can render to an HTML Document.
gomponents aims to make it easy to build HTML pages of reusable components,
without the use of a template language. Think server-side-rendered React,
but without the virtual DOM and diffing.

The implementation is still incomplete, but usable. The API may change until version 1 is reached.
