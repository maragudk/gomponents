Try HTML components in pure Go.

_gomponents_ are HTML components written in pure Go.
They render to HTML 5, and make it easy for you to build reusable components.
So you can focus on building your app instead of learning yet another templating language.

```shell
go get maragu.dev/gomponents
```

## Features

Check out [www.gomponents.com](https://www.gomponents.com) for an introduction.

- Build reusable HTML components
- Write declarative HTML 5 in Go without all the strings, so you get
  - Type safety from the compiler
  - Auto-completion from the IDE
  - Easy debugging with the standard Go debugger
  - Automatic formatting with `gofmt`/`goimports`
- Simple API that's easy to learn and use (you know most already if you know HTML)
- Useful helpers like
  - `Text` and `Textf` that insert HTML-escaped text,
  - `Raw` and `Rawf` for inserting raw strings,
  - `Map` for mapping data to components and `Group` for grouping components,
  - and `If`/`Iff` for conditional rendering.
- No external dependencies
- Mature and stable, no breaking changes

## Usage

```shell
go get maragu.dev/gomponents
```

```go
package main

import (
	. "maragu.dev/gomponents"
	. "maragu.dev/gomponents/components"
	. "maragu.dev/gomponents/html"
)

func Navbar(authenticated bool, currentPath string) Node {
	return Nav(
		NavbarLink("/", "Home", currentPath),
		NavbarLink("/about", "About", currentPath),
		If(authenticated, NavbarLink("/profile", "Profile", currentPath)),
	)
}

func NavbarLink(href, name, currentPath string) Node {
	return A(Href(href), Classes{"is-active": currentPath == href}, g.Text(name))
}
```

(Some people don't like dot-imports, and luckily it's completely optional.)

For a more complete example, see [the examples directory](internal/examples/).
There's also the [gomponents-starter-kit](https://github.com/maragudk/gomponents-starter-kit) for a full application template.

## Architecture

gomponents is organized into several packages:

- `gomponents`: Core interfaces and functions like `Node`, `El`, `Attr`, and helpers like `Map`, `Group`, `If`, `Text`, `Raw`.
- `gomponents/html`: HTML elements and attributes.
- `gomponents/components`: Higher-level components and utilities.
- `gomponents/http`: HTTP-related utilities for web servers.

### Void Elements

Void elements in HTML (like `<br>`, `<img>`, `<input>`) don't have closing tags.
gomponents handles these correctly by checking against an internal list of void elements during rendering.
When you create a void element, any child nodes that are not attributes will be ignored automatically to ensure valid HTML output.

## Performance Considerations

gomponents renders directly to an `io.Writer`, making it efficient for server-side rendering.
The library avoids unnecessary allocations where possible.

## FAQ

### Is gomponents production-ready?

Yes! gomponents is mature, stable, fully tested with 100% coverage, and has been used in production by myself and many others.

### Should I choose `html/template`, Templ, or gomponents?

These are all good choices, and it largely comes down to preference.
I wrote gomponents because I didn't like how I think it's hard to pass data around between templates in `html/template`.
gomponents is pure Go, with no extra build step like Templ, so it works with all tools that already support Go.

That said, both `html/template` and Templ will do the same thing as gomponents in the end. Try them all and choose what you like!

### I don't like how HTML looks in Go.

First of all, that's not a question. ðŸ˜‰

More seriously, think of gomponents like a DSL for HTML. You're building UI components. Give it a day, and it'll feel natural.

### I'd like to add feature X, can I do that?

First of all, thank you for wanting to contribute! ðŸ˜Š See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a guide.

I accept code contributions, especially with new HTML elements and attributes.
I always welcome issues discussing interesting aspects of gomponents, and obviously bug reports and the like.
But otherwise, I consider gomponents pretty much feature complete.

New features to the core library are unlikely to be merged, since I like keeping it simple and the API small.
In particular, new functions around collections (similar to `Map`) or flow control (`IfElse`/`Else`) will not be added.
`Map` was introduced before generics where a thing, and I think it's better to start using generic functions
from the stdlib or other libraries, instead of adding gomponents-specific variations of them to this library.

If there's something missing that you need, I would recommend to keep small helper functions around in your own projects.
And if all else fails, you can always use an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE):

```go
func list(ordered bool) Node {
	return func() Node {
		// Do whatever you need to do, imperatively
		if ordered {
			return Ol()
		} else {
			return Ul()
		}
	}()
}
```

### What's up with the specially named elements and attributes?

Unfortunately, there are some name clashes in HTML elements and attributes, so they need an `El` or `Attr` suffix,
to be able to co-exist in the same package in Go.

I've chosen one or the other based on what I think is the common usage.
In either case, the less-used variant also exists in the codebase:

- `cite` (`Cite`/`CiteAttr`, `CiteEl` also exists)
- `data` (`DataEl`/`Data`, `DataAttr` also exists)
- `form` (`Form`/`FormAttr`, `FormEl` also exists)
- `label` (`Label`/`LabelAttr`, `LabelEl` also exists)
- `style` (`StyleEl`/`Style`, `StyleAttr` also exists)
- `title` (`TitleEl`/`Title`, `TitleAttr` also exists)

<details>
	<summary>Example with `Style` and `StyleEl`</summary>

```go
package html

import (
	. "maragu.dev/gomponents"
	. "maragu.dev/gomponents/components"
	. "maragu.dev/gomponents/html"
)

func MyPage() Node {
	return HTML5(HTML5Props{
		Title: "My Page",
		Head: []Node{
			StyleEl(g.Raw("body {background-color: #fff; }")),
		},
		Body: []Node{
			H1(Style("color: #000"), Text("My Page")),
		},
	})
}
```
